# ComfyUI-kaola-moss-ttsd

A ComfyUI custom node pack for the [MOSS-TTS Family](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/MOSS-TTS) — a suite of open-source speech and audio generation models. This pack provides nodes for **dialogue synthesis**, **narration**, **voice design**, and **sound effects**.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Multi-Speaker Dialogue (MOSS-TTSD)**: Generate expressive multi-party conversations with up to 5 speakers using `[S1]`~`[S5]` tags. Supports long-form (up to 60 min) coherent audio.
- 🗣️ **Narration & TTS (MOSS-TTS)**: High-fidelity single-speaker speech synthesis with zero-shot voice cloning. Available in 8B and 1.7B variants.
- 🎨 **Voice Design (MOSS-VoiceGenerator)**: Create speaker timbres from text descriptions — no reference audio needed.
- 🔊 **Sound Effects (MOSS-SoundEffect)**: Generate sound effects from text prompts with controllable duration.
- 🔄 **Zero-Shot Voice Cloning**: Clone any voice with just a short reference audio clip.
- 🌍 **Multilingual**: Supports 20+ languages including Chinese, English, Japanese, and more.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> We strongly recommend creating a fresh **Python 3.12** environment to avoid dependency conflicts:
> ```bash
> conda create -n moss_ttsd python=3.12 -y && conda activate moss_ttsd
> pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
> ```

1.  Clone this repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory:
    ```bash
    cd custom_nodes
